I'm an iOS Engineer from France 🇫🇷 currently working on making health data more accessible at [Withings](https://withings.com).  
I'm studying software engineering at EPITECH France, and I've had the opportunity to spend a study abroad year in Long Beach, California at CSULB.

I love building new things, being creative, working on Swift applications, libraries etc.

I've been interning as an iOS Developer at [Leocare](https://leocare.eu) and as a Web Developer at [Paladium](https://paladium-pvp.fr).
